# NumberGuessing
The computer picks a secret number between 1 and 100.
You try to guess the number by typing your guess.
After each guess, the computer tells you:
“Too low!” if your guess is smaller than the secret number.
“Too high!” if your guess is bigger than the secret number.
When you guess correctly, it says “Correct!” and shows how many tries it took.
The game uses a loop to keep going until you win!
